title: Automating DevOps - Azure Active Directory Security Group Through ADO REST API
slug: automating-devops-rest-api-001

summary: 

Background
====

Lately I have been working on a project where I needed to automate the creation of a Azure DevOps project and integrate it with an ITSM system. One of the key requirements of automating the creation was to make sure that a range of different tasks were included in the automation. Among them was the task to *Programmatically create and add a AAD-security group to Azure DevOps project*

After a quick google search I learned that everything we can do in the portal, can be done via REST API, refer to [DevOps (ADO REST API](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/rest/api/azure/devops/?view=azure-devops-rest-7.1&viewFallbackFrom=azure-devops-rest-6.1). 

Which is awesome! But without knowing the ins and outs of how ADO is built, I was quite unfamiliar with all the endpoints, methods and payloads I would need to aware of. The docs were a huge help but did not get me to the finishing line. I need to know the sequence of requests including their payloads, headers and methods.

Which made me wonder, what if I can use the network capture in my browser when I manually add Azure Security groups to a DevOps Project and (hopefully) learn something useful.

Authentication
===

Before we start, lets cover how I authenticated to ADO from my python script.

Basic Auth is used for authentication (at least when for debugging purposes). I wrote a wrapper class for DevOps which takes care of authentication and interacting with the ADO REST API. I wrote python because it is awesome to work with when something needs to be written quickly, and because I am building everything as a Azure Function App.

Here we see the authentication part of my Function App

    import base64
    import json
    import logging
    import requests

    class HttpRequest(object):
        def __init__(self, url:str, method:str, headers:dict=None, payload:dict=None):
            if headers == None:
                headers = {}
            if payload == None:
                payload = {}

            self.url = url
            self.method = method
            self.headers = headers
            self.payload = payload

        @property
        def http_settings(self):
            return {
                'url': self.url,
                'method': self.method,
                'headers': self.headers,
                'payload': self.payload
            }

    class Authentication(HttpRequest):

        def __init__(self, url: str = None, method: str = None, headers: dict = None, payload: dict = None):
            super().__init__(url, method, headers, payload)
        
        def init_devops(self, username, password):
            """
                Create a basic authentication header used by devops
                Returns a dictionary
            """
            auth_string = base64.b64encode(
                f'{username}:{password}'.encode()).decode()
            return {
                'Content-Type': 'application/json',
                'Authorization': f'Basic {auth_string}',
            }

    class DevOps(HttpRequest):

        def __init__(self, organization, username, password, 
                url: str = None, method: str = None, headers: dict = None, payload: dict = None):
                
            super().__init__(url, method, headers, payload)
            self.base_url = f"https://dev.azure.com/{organization}"
            self.vseax_url = f"https://vsaex.dev.azure.com/{organization}"
            self.vssps_url = f"https://vssps.dev.azure.com/{organization}"
            self.headers = Authentication().init_devops(username, password)


Requirements
====
This acticle does assume that the following have been created:

* ADO organization has been created and is linked to an active Azure tenant.
* A ADO project


Whats goes on under the hood?
====
By using the developer tools's networking monitor it is possible to capture the order of HTTP requests made to the DevOps API.

Adding a new group to a project from the portal looks like the following:

*Figure 1*

When capturing the events that occur after submitting the form the following can be observed:
![alt text](../pictures/requests_capture_01.png "Capture001")

Looks interesting, lets take a deeper look at the POST and PUT messages


**Interpretation**

1 - Creating a VSS group
---
POST `https://vssps.dev.azure.com/[orgName]/_apis/Graph/Groups?scopeDescriptor=scp.OTdjNTcwMzItMmEzNy00YWNkLWJhMGQtNzQ0YjhkNTdhY2Vh`
    
* **Endpoint** `_apis/Graph/Groups`
* **Parameters**: `scopeDescriptor=[theScopeDecriptorOfOurDevOpsProject]`
* **Payload**

        {
            "displayName":"XXX Azure Devops Licenses","description":"",
            "storageKey":"",
            "crossProject":false,
            "descriptor":"",
            "restrictedVisibility":false,"specialGroupType":"Generic"
        }


This endpoint adds a vssps group (seen in the **Name** field in figure 1) group to the **project scope** of our DevOps Organization. 

**Response**:

        {
            ...
            ...
            descriptor: "vssgp.Uy0xLTk..."
        }

2 - Adding AAD group to ADO
---          
POST: `https://vssps.dev.azure.com/[Organization]/_apis/Graph/Groups?groupDescriptors=vssgp.Uy0xLTk...`
    
* **Endpoint**: `_apis/Graph/Groups`
* **Parameters**: `groupDescriptors=[groupDescriptorFromLastRequest]`
* **Payload**

        {
            "originId":"194b296b-7f7f-4bb7-8d92-f1122e286b60","storageKey":""
        }

The payload contains the objectId of the request Azure AD security group. Which is sent to a url containing a reference to the previously created group.

* **response**

        {
            ...
            ...
            descriptor: "aadgp.Uy0xLTkt..."
        }
    

3 - Creating a membership
---

PUT `https://vssps.dev.azure.com/[Organazation]/_apis/Graph/Memberships/aadgp.Uy0xLTkt.../vssgp.Uy0xLTkt...`

* **Endpoint**: `__apis/Graph/Memberships`
* **Parameters**: `None`
* **Payload**: `None`

Neither payload nor parameters, however, we can clearly see that the url is structered in such as way that both vsspgp and aadgp descriptors are included. Occording to the [Official docs](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/rest/api/azure/devops/graph/memberships/add?view=azure-devops-rest-7.1) this creates a so called membership between a container (our vss group) and a subject (the Azure Active Directory group).

* **Response**: 

        {
            containerDescriptor: "vssgp.Uy0xLTkt...Ë‡X",
            memberDescriptor: "aadgp.Uy0xLTkt..."
        }
    

    A membership basically describes a linkage between a VSS and AAD group

Writing methods with Python
====
Lets expand the DevOps class mentioned earlier where I covered authentication, lets focus on adding methods that interact with endpoints we just observed.

Before we can start, we need to programatically retrieve the `scopeDescriptor` for our **project** before we can start adding groups to it. Knowing the **project_id** we can list its properties (the project id can be retrieved using [this endpoint](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/rest/api/azure/devops/core/projects/list?view=azure-devops-rest-7.1).


    class DevOps(HttpRequest):
        ...
        ...
        ...
        def get_existing_projects(self):
            existing_projects = {}
            self.url = f"{self.base_url}/_apis/projects?api-version=5.0"
            self.method ="GET"
            submit = requests.request(**self.http_settings)

            for project in submit.response["value"]:
                existing_projects[project["name"]] = project["id"]
            return existing_projects

        def get_project_scope_descriptor(self, project_id):
            self.url = f"{self.vssps_url}/_apis/graph/descriptors/{project_id}"
            self.method = "GET"
            self.payload = None
            submit = requests.request(**self.http_settings)
            return submit.response


Lets convert all three steps from the network capture to python


**Adding VSS group to Project**

    class DevOps(HttpRequest):
        ...
        ...
        ...
        def create_group_under_project_scope(self, scope_descriptor, group_name):
            self.url = f'{self.vssps_url}/_apis/Graph/Groups?scopeDescriptor={scope_descriptor}&api-version=6.0-preview.1'
            self.method = "POST"
            self.payload = json.dumps(
                {
                    "displayName": group_name,
                    "description": "",
                    "storageKey": "",
                    "crossProject": False,
                    "descriptor": "",
                    "restrictedVisibility": False,
                    "specialGroupType":"Generic"
                }
            )
            submit = requests.request(**self.http_settings)
            return submit.response


**Adding Azure AD group to DevOps**

    class DevOps(HttpRequest):
        ...
        ...
        ...
        def add_aad_group_to_devops(self, group_descriptor, aad_group_oid):
            self.url = f"{self.vssps_url}/_apis/Graph/Groups?groupDescriptors={group_descriptor}&api-version=6.0-preview.1"
            self.method = "POST"
            self.payload = json.dumps(
                    {
                        "originId": f"{aad_group_oid}"
                    }
                )
            submit = requests.request(**self.http_settings)
            return submit.response

**Create a membership between AAD and VSS groups**

    class DevOps(HttpRequest):
        ...
        ...
        ...
        def link_aad_group_with_project_group(self, aad_group_descriptor, project_group_descriptor):
            self.url = f"{self.vssps_url}/_apis/Graph/Memberships/{aad_group_descriptor}/{project_group_descriptor}?api-version=6.0-preview.1"
            self.method = "PUT"
            self.payload = None
            submit = requests.request(**self.http_settings)
            return submit.response


Wrap it up
====


    class DevOps(HttpRequest):
        ...
        ...
        ...
        def add_aad_group_to_project(self, aad_group_oid:str, aad_group_name:str, project_id:str):
            project_scope_descriptor = self.get_project_scope_descriptor(project_id)['value']
            project_group_descriptor = self.create_group_under_project_scope(
                scope_descriptor=project_scope_descriptor, 
                group_name=aad_group_name
            )['descriptor']
            aad_group_descriptor = self.add_aad_group_to_devops(
                aad_group_oid=aad_group_oid,
                group_descriptor=project_group_descriptor
            )['descriptor']
            self.link_aad_group_with_project_group(
                aad_group_descriptor=aad_group_descriptor,
                project_group_descriptor=project_group_descriptor
            )

    devops_credentials = {
        'organization': os.getenv("DEVOPS_ORGANIZATION_NAME"),
        'username': os.getenv("DEVOPS_USERNAME"),
        'password': os.getenv("DEVOPS_PAT_TOKEN")
    }

    org = DevOps(
        organization=devops_credentials['organization'],
        username=devops_credentials['username'],
        password=devops_credentials['password']
    )

    project_id = org.get_existing_projects()["Project001"]

    # Create a new licensing group
    org.add_aad_group_to_project(
        aad_group_oid="194b296b-7f7f-4bb7-8d92-f1122e286b60",
        aad_group_name="Project001 Licensed Users",
        project_id=project_id
    )

Conclusion
===

Now I have a script that automatically adds Azure Active directory security groups to any Azure DevOps project as long as I know the ID.

What I covered here was just a single task, but I think the method covered here can be applied to the process of automating more tasks through the ADO API.

Which is why I think this was fun write-up about one of the many experiences I learned while working with Azure DevOps.

Thanks for reading!
